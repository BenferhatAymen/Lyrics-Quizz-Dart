# Lyrics Quizz Dart

Lyrics Quizz Dart is a simple command-line quiz game written in Dart. The game presents the user with lyrics and asks them to guess the rapper. This code is for learning purposes.

## How to Play

1. Make sure you have Dart installed on your system. If you don't have Dart installed, you can download it from the [Dart website](https://dart.dev/get-dart).
2. Create a file named `questions.txt` in the same directory as the Dart file. Each line of the file should contain a question and answer separated by `-%-`. For example: `Lyrics here -%- Rapper name here`.
3. Run the Dart file using the command `dart quizz.dart`.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
